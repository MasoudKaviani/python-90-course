#  Introduction

If you Read and Follow **Job Ads** to hire a machine learning expert or a data scientist, you find that some skills you should have to get the job.
In this Repository, I want to review **10 skills** that are essentials to get the job.

In fact, this Repository is a reference for **10 other Notebooks**, which you can learn with them,  all of the skills that you need.

# Do You Need Help?

I hope you have enjoyed reading my python notebooks.

If you have any problem and question to run notebook please open an issue here in GitHub.

for most of the my notebook you need **dataset** as input.

To use the **correct data**, please **download** the data set from  the **Kaggle** site and put it in your notebook folder.
