# Django Migrations: A Primer

This directory contains the Django project created in the article [Django Migrations: A Primer](https://realpython.com/django-migrations-a-primer/).

It is also used in the follow up article [Digging Deeper into Migrations](https://realpython.com/digging-deeper-into-migrations/).

**Note:** The code in this directory has been reformatted with black and might therefore differ slightly in codestyle from the code originally generated by Django.

## Installation

This Project has been tested with Python 3.6 and Django 2.1, but you should be able to run it with an Django 2.x and a compatible Python. The recommended way to install it is using `pip` and a virtualenv:

    $ python3 -m venv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    (.venv) $ pip install "Django==2.*"
