# Primer on Python Decorators

Code examples from the [Primer on Python Decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) tutorial on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/).

## Decorators

As noted in the article, most decorators are stored in the file [`decorators.py`](https://github.com/realpython/materials/blob/master/primer-on-python-decorators/decorators.py). The exceptions are those decorators that depend on third party packages ([Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/)), which are available in [`decorators_flask.py`](https://github.com/realpython/materials/blob/master/primer-on-python-decorators/decorators_flask.py) and [`decorators_unit.py`](https://github.com/realpython/materials/blob/master/primer-on-python-decorators/decorators_unit.py), respectively.

## Examples

Most of the code examples from the article are available in the [`examples.py`](https://github.com/realpython/materials/blob/master/primer-on-python-decorators/examples.py) file.
