**Where to put new files:**

- New files should go into a top-level subfolder, named after the article slug. For example: `my-awesome-article`

**How to merge your changes:** 

1. [Make sure the CI code style tests all pass (+ run the automatic code formatter if necessary).](https://github.com/realpython/materials/blob/master/README.md)
2. Find an RP Team member on Slack and ask them to review & approve your PR.
3. Once the PR has one positive ("approved") review, GitHub lets you merge the PR.
